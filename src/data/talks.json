When announcements are made, they need to be catchy, sleek and able to generate hype\u2026 and how, for the Nth time, RN is better than tech X or faster than tech Y.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not all that is happening: under the surface, deep down in the mines of the foundation of this ecosystem, there\u2019s a steady stream of work, discussions and considerations happening - all driven by the pressing need to constantly shift React Native into something more solid and better structured. In this talk, I want to take you down into the guts of these conversations, and shine a light onto some of these radical changes, how they are shaped up and what to expect in the future of React Native.",

You don't need it; in fact, it will just complicate your life. \r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, you have found yourself managing small applications that have gotten too big and no one has control over them anymore; if you have gotten to the point where you wonder what would be the best architecture for a single-page application; if with each new project you try a different combination of libraries/structure/conventions, and after six months you don't like it anymore; if your application is impossible to test and you have been forced to write hundreds of end-to-end tests.\r\n\r\nThen this talk is for you. By applying the correct design principles and design patterns, we will see how we can create a three-tier UI architecture that allows us to build applications with React that are clean, maintainable, testable, and infinitely scalable. \r\n\r\nPs: we will not talk about the folder structure but how to split and decouple the components of a React application as much as possible and create a design we are proud of.",

        "abstract": "Sometimes we come across the need to use some native APIs or 3rd-party libraries in our React Native application, but there is no such library available yet or all of them are of poor quality or, even worse, unmaintained.\r\nCreating a native module for React Native always sounds like a pain, especially for us, React Native developers who usually specialize in React and JavaScript/TypeScript. Learning Objective-C, Java or C++ just to make a library can be challenging and expensive.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'm going to show how Expo with its Expo Modules API changed the way of writing native modules for React Native, making it much easier, more approachable and enjoyable for developers who are comfortable with TypeScript and have limited experience in mobile development. The Expo modules are written in more modern languages: Swift and Kotlin which are more similar to TypeScript. We will walk through how it differs from the standard Bridge and Turbo modules and show some of the features it offers.",

In Belka we created a boilerplate and documentation to build a reproducible process for web design systems but soon we realised that the logic and the code structure for mobile design systems are slightly different from what we chose.\r\nBut we were sure about one thing: using Storybook. In this talk, we will explain and analyze the decisions we made in terms of design systems for React Native apps. We will dive into the implementation of Storybook and show how it can be used to build a reproducible process. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how to use Storybook to create design systems for React Native apps and how to adapt them from the web to the mobile environment.",
